          <h1> About Us</h1>
          <h4> Welcome to Cup of Joe, where every cup tells a story! </h4>
          <p> At Cup of Joe, we believe that coffee is more than just a beverage 
            <br> it's a catalyst for connection, creativity, and community. 
            <br> Founded in 2019 by coffee and music enthusiasts Mean Dianne Lego, 
            <br> our caf√© was born out of a shared passion for great coffee and heartfelt conversations.
          </p>
          <p> It all started with a simple idea: to create a space where people could gather, unwind, and savor the moment over a perfect cup of coffee. 
            <br>Inspired by the Filipino band, Cup of Joe,  we set out to create a space where music and coffee converge to ignite the senses and inspire the soul.
          </p>
          <p> Whether you're a fan of our favorite band or simply someone who appreciates good music and great coffee, 
            <br>Cup of Joe welcomes you with open arms. Join us as we celebrate the power of music to bring people together, create lasting memories, and inspire us to live life to the fullest.
            <br> Thank you for being a part of our story!
